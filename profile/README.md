# **What is Covest Finance** <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39422342/167291196-96b7f01b-902c-4d9b-9e76-9047ea4f6d98.png" width="45" />

Covest Finance is a peer-to-peer insurance protocol that enabled people to share risk together without the need for insurance companies as the entities to manage and custody the fund.

# **Pay only what necessary**

We revolutionized an insurance business by leveraging a blockchain-based solution to create a people-powered insurance ecosystem that is more cost-effective and more transparent.

# **Run by members and thrive together**

A community-run insurance business is formed to unify the goals and entirely owned by its members, with all profits going back to the members.
